# About

Metro is a high-performance, extensible, easy-to-use web service stack. It is a one-stop shop for all your web service needs, from the simplest hello world web service to reliable, secured, and transacted web service that involves .NET services. The Metro web service stack is a part of the GlassFish community, but it can be also used outside GlassFish.

Metro consists of JAX-WS Reference Implementation project and 
Web Services Interoperability Technology project.

JAX-WS Reference Implementation (JAX-WS RI) provides core web servicing
support and the base framework for extensions provided by the WSIT layer.

Web Services Interoperability Technologies (WSIT) (previously known as
Project Tango) includes implementations of: 
- SOAP over TCP 
- WS-AtomicTransactions/Coordination
- WS-MetadataExchange
- WS-Policy (https://github.com/javaee/metro-policy)
- WS-ReliableMessaging
- WS-SecureConversation
- WS-Security
- WS-SecurityPolicy
- WS-Trust

Note:
- WS-Policy (https://github.com/javaee/metro-policy)

has its own codebase however WS-Policy related issues can be submitted into
the Metro (WSIT) Issue tracker
