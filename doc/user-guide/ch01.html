        Microsoft to ensure interoperability of web services enterprise
        technologies such as security , reliable messaging, and atomic
        transactions. That portion of Metro is known as WSIT (Web Service
        Interoperability Technologies). Metro's WSIT subsystem is an
        implementation of a number of open web services specifications to
        support enterprise features. In addition to security, reliable
        messaging, and atomic transactions, Metro includes a bootstrapping and
        configuration technology. <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#ahial" title="Figure&nbsp;1.1.&nbsp;Metro's WSIT Web Services Features">Metro's WSIT Web Services Features</a> shows the underlying services that were

            data among applications over the Internet. The data shared can
            vary in format and include large binary payloads, such as
            documents, images, music files, and so on. When large binary
            objects are encoded into XML format for inclusion in SOAP
            messages, even larger files are produced. When a web service
            processes and transmits these large files over the network, the
            performance of the web service application and the network are
            negatively affected. In the worst case scenario the effects are as
            follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The performance of the web service application
                    degrades to a point that it is no longer useful.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The network gets bogged down with more traffic than
                    the allotted bandwidth can handle.</p></li></ul></div><p>One way to deal with this problem is to encode the binary
            objects so as to optimize both the SOAP application processing
            time and the bandwidth required to transmit the SOAP message over
            the network. In short, XML needs to be optimized for web services.
            This is the exactly what the Message Optimization technology does.
            It ensures that web services messages are transmitted over the
            Internet in the most efficient manner.</p><p>Sun recommends that you use message optimization if your web
            service client or web service endpoint will be required to process
            binary encoded XML documents larger than 1KB.</p><p>For instructions on how to use the Message Optimization
            technology, see <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Message Optimization"><i>Message Optimization</i></a>.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.2.3.&nbsp;Reliable Messaging Technology"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ahiap"></a>1.2.3.&nbsp;Reliable Messaging Technology</h3></div></div></div><p>Reliable Messaging is a Quality of Service (QoS) technology
            for building more reliable web services. Reliability (in terms of
            what is provided by WS-ReliableMessaging) is measured by a
            system's ability to deliver messages from point A to point B. The
            primary purpose of Reliable Messaging is to ensure the delivery of
            application messages to web service endpoints.</p><p>The reliable messaging technology ensures that messages in a
            given message sequence are delivered at least once and not more
            than once and optionally in the correct order. When messages in a
            given sequence are lost in transit or delivered out of order, this
            technology enables systems to recover from such failures. If a
            message is lost in transit, the sending system retransmits the
            message until its receipt is acknowledged by the receiving system.
            If messages are received out of order, the receiving system may
            re-order the messages into the correct order.</p><p>You should consider using reliable messaging if the web
            service is experiencing the following types of problems:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Communication failures are occurring that result in
                    the network being unavailable or connections being
                    dropped</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Application messages are being lost in
                    transit</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Application messages are arriving at their
                    destination out of order and ordered delivery is a
                    requirement</p></li></ul></div><p>To help decide whether or not to use reliable messaging,
            weigh the following advantages and disadvantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Enabling reliable messaging ensures that messages
                    are delivered exactly once from the source to the
                    destination and, if the ordered-delivery option is
                    enabled, ensures that messages are delivered in
                    order.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Enabling reliable messaging uses more memory
                    (especially if the ordered delivery option is enabled)
                    since messages must be stored (even after they are sent)
                    until receipt is acknowledged.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Non-reliable messaging clients cannot interoperate
                    with web services that have reliable messaging
                    enabled.</p></li></ul></div><p>For instructions on how to use the Reliable Messaging
            technology, see <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Using Reliable Messaging"><i>Using Reliable Messaging</i></a>.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.2.4.&nbsp;Security Technology"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ahiaq"></a>1.2.4.&nbsp;Security Technology</h3></div></div></div><p>Until now, web services have relied on transport-based
            security such as SSL to provide point-to-point security. Metro
            implements WS-Security so as to provide interoperable message
            content integrity and confidentiality, even when messages pass
            through intermediary nodes before reaching their destination
            endpoint. WS-Security as provided by Metro is in addition to
            existing transport-level security, which may still be used.</p><p>Metro also enhances security by implementing WS-Secure
            Conversation, which enables a consumer and provider to establish a
            shared security context when a multiple-message-exchange sequence
            is first initiated. Subsequent messages use derived session keys
            that increase the overall security while reducing the security
            processing overhead for each message.</p><p>Further, Metro implements two additional features to improve
            security in web services:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Web Services Trust</em></span>: Enables web
                    service applications to use SOAP messages to request
                    security tokens that can then be used to establish trusted
                    communications between a client and a web service.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Web Services Security Policy</em></span>:
                    Enables web services to use security assertions to clearly
                    represent security preferences and requirements for web
                    service endpoints.</p></li></ul></div><p>Metro implements these features in such a way as to ensure
            that web service binding security requirements, as defined in the
            WSDL file, can interoperate with and be consumed by Metro and WCF
            endpoints.</p><p>For instructions on how to use the WS-Security technology,

        Microsoft. We test and deliver products to market that interoperate
        across different platforms.</p><p>Metro is the product of Sun's web services interoperability
        initiative. Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) in .NET is
        Microsoft's unified programming model for building connected systems.
        WCF, which is available as part of the .NET Framework 3.x product,
        includes application programming interfaces (APIs) for building
        secure, reliable, transacted web services that interoperate with
        non-Microsoft platforms.</p><p>Sun Microsystems and Microsoft jointly test Metro against WCF to
        ensure that Sun web service clients (consumers) and web services
        (producers) do in fact interoperate with WCF web services applications
        and vice versa. This testing ensures that the following
        interoperability goals are realized:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Metro web services clients can access and consume WCF

                    specify policy information in a standardized way. However,
                    this specification does not provide a protocol that
                    constitutes a negotiation or message exchange solution for

                    is used in conjunction with the WS-Metadata Exchange
                    protocol. When applied in the web services model, policy
                    is used to convey conditions on interactions between two
                    web service endpoints. Typically, the provider of a web

                    implementations, client requests and web service responses
                    are most often transmitted as SOAP messages over HTTP to
                    enable a completely interoperable exchange between clients
                    and web services, all running on different platforms and
                    at various locations on the Internet. HTTP is a familiar
                    request-and response standard for sending messages over
                    the Internet, and SOAP is an XML-based protocol that
                    follows the HTTP request-and-response model. In SOAP 1.1,
                    the SOAP portion of a transported message handles the

                                (for example in the HTTP transport header), thus
                                enabling SOAP messages to be transport
                                independent.</p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Web Services Addressing</em></span>: This
                    specification defines a endpoint reference representation.
                    A web service endpoint is an entity, processor, or
                    resource that can be referenced and to which web services
                    messages can be addressed. Endpoint references convey the
                    information needed to address a web service endpoint. The
                    specification defines two constructs: message addressing
                    properties and endpoint references, that normalize the
                    information typically provided by transport protocols and
                    messaging systems in a way that is independent of any
                    particular transport or messaging system. This is
                    accomplished by defining XML tags for including web
                    service addresses in the SOAP message, instead of the HTTP
                    header. The implementation of these features enables
                    messaging systems to support message transmission in a
                    transport-neutral manner through networks that include
                    processing nodes such as endpoint managers, firewalls, and
                    gateways.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Web Services Secure

                    standard mechanisms for optimizing the transmission format
                    of SOAP messages by selectively encoding portions of the
                    SOAP message, while still presenting an XML Infoset to the
                    SOAP application. This mechanism enables the definition of
                    a hop-by-hop contract between a SOAP node and the next
                    SOAP node in the SOAP message path so as to facilitate the
                    efficient pass-through of optimized data contained within
                    headers or bodies of SOAP messages that are relayed by an

                    and efficiency in multiple-message exchanges. The Metro
                    implementation provides basic mechanisms on top of which
                    secure messaging semantics can be defined for
                    multiple-message exchanges and allows for contexts to be
                    established along with more efficient keys or new key

                    Services Security specification, described above, focuses
                    on the message authentication model, it does leave
                    openings for several forms of attacks. The Secure

                    standardized way to authenticate a series of messages,
                    thereby addressing the short comings of Web Services
                    Security. With the Web Services Security Conversation
                    model, the security context is defined as a new Web
                    Services security token type that is obtained using a

        the message optimization, reliable messaging, and security
        technologies work.</p><div class="section" title="1.5.1.&nbsp;How Message Optimization Works"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ahibc"></a>1.5.1.&nbsp;How Message Optimization Works</h3></div></div></div><p>Message optimization ensures that web services messages are
            transmitted over the Internet in the most efficient manner.
            Because XML is a textual format, binary files must be represented
            using character sequences before they can be embedded in an XML
            document. A popular encoding that permits this embedding is known
            as base64 encoding, which corresponds to the XML Schema data type
            xsd:base64Binary. In a web services toolkit that supports a
            binding framework, a value of this type must be encoded before
            transmission and decoded before binding. The encoding and decoding
            process is expensive and the costs increase linearly as the size
            of the binary object increases.</p><p>Message optimization enables web service endpoints to
            identify large binary message payloads, remove the message
            payloads from the body of the SOAP message, encode the message
            payloads using an efficient encoding mechanism (effectively
            reducing the size of the payloads), re-insert the message payloads
            into the SOAP message as attachments (the file is linked to the
            SOAP message body by means of an Include tag). Thus, message
            optimization is achieved by encoding binary objects prior to
            transmission and then de-encoding them when they reach there final
            destination.</p><p>The optimization process is really quite simple. To effect
            optimized message transmissions, the sending endpoint checks the
            body of the SOAP message for XML encoded binary objects that
            exceed a predetermined size and encodes those objects for
            efficient transmission over the Internet.</p><p>SOAP MTOM, paired with the XML-binary Optimized Packaging
            (XOP), addresses the inefficiencies related to the transmission of
            binary data in SOAP documents. Using MTOM and XOP, XML messages
            are dissected in order to transmit binary files as MIME
            attachments in a way that is transparent to the application. This
            transformation is restricted to base64 content in canonical form
            as defined in XSD Datatypes as specified in XML Schema Part 2:
            Datatypes Second Edition, W3C Recommendation 28 October
            2004.</p><p>Thus, the Metro technology achieves message optimization
            through an implementation of the MTOM and XOP specifications. With
            the message optimization feature enabled, small binary objects are
            sent in-line in the SOAP body. For large binary objects, this
            becomes quite inefficient, so the binary object is separated from
            the SOAP body, encoded, sent as an attachment to the SOAP message,
            and decoded when it reaches its destination endpoint.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.5.2.&nbsp;How Reliable Messaging Works"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ahibd"></a>1.5.2.&nbsp;How Reliable Messaging Works</h3></div></div></div><p>When reliable messaging is enabled, messages are grouped
            into sequences, which are defined by the client's proxies. Each
            proxy corresponds to a message sequence, which consists of all of
            the request messages for that proxy. Each message contains a
            sequence header. The header includes a sequence identifier that
            identifies the sequence and a unique message number that indicates
            the order of the message in the sequence. The web service endpoint
            uses the sequence header information to group the messages and, if
            the Ordered Delivery option is selected, to process them in the
            proper order. Additionally, if secure conversation is enabled,
            each message sequence is assigned its own security context token.
            The security context token is used to sign the handshake messages
            that initialize communication between two web service endpoints
            and subsequent application messages.</p><p>Thus, using the Reliable Messaging technology, web service
            endpoints collaborate to determine which messages in a particular
            application message sequence arrived at the destination endpoint
            and which messages require resending. The reliable messaging
            protocol requires that the destination endpoint return
            message-receipt acknowledgements that include the sequence
            identifier and the message number of each message received. If the
            source determines that a message was not received by the
            destination, it resends the message and requests an
            acknowledgement. Once the source has sent all messages for a given
            sequence and their receipt has been acknowledged by the
            destination, the source terminates the sequence.</p><p>The web service destination endpoint in turn sends the
            application messages along to the application. If ordered delivery
            is configured (optional), the destination endpoint reconstructs a
            complete stream of messages for each sequence in the exact order
            in which the messages were sent and sends them along to the
            destination application. Thus, through the use of the reliable
            messaging protocol, the destination endpoint is able to provide
            the following delivery assurances to the web service
            application:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Each message is delivered to the destination
                    application at least once.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each message is delivered to the destination

            them for ordered-delivery guarantee. After guaranteeing order, if

                builds on the features provided by the Web Service Policy
                implementation in Metro. It enables users to use XML elements
                to specify the security requirements of a web service
                endpoint, that is, how messages are secured on the
                communication path between the client and the web service. The
                web service endpoint specifies the security requirements to
                the client as assertions (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#ahibi" title="Figure&nbsp;1.9.&nbsp;Security Policy Exchange">Security Policy Exchange</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a name="ahibi"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.9.&nbsp;Security Policy Exchange</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td><img src="figures/securityPolicyExchange.png" height="360" alt="Security Policy Exchange"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The security policy model uses the policy specified in
                the WSDL file for associating policy assertions with web
                service communication. As a result, whenever possible, the
                security policy assertions do not use parameters or
                attributes. This enables first-level, <code class="code">QName</code>-based
                assertion matching to be done at the framework level without
                security domain-specific knowledge. The first-level matching
                provides a narrowed set of policy alternatives that are shared
                by the client and web service endpoint when they attempt to
                establish a secure communication path.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>A <code class="code">QName</code> is a qualified name, as

                to find common security alternatives and that many aspects of
                security can be factored out and reused. For example, it may
                be common that the security mechanism is constant for a web

                        assertions are used to protect the indicated message
                        parts. For example, the assertions might specify that
